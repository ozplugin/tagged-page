# Tagged page

## Requirements

* Wordpress > 6.2
* PHP > 8.0

## Installation

Download as archive and install as regular WordPress plugin

## How it works
The plugin adds two new accordions - "Related Pages" and "Tags" - to the settings sidebar of the WordPress page editor

Tags accordion works like regular tags and can be added either directly in the editor through a field (after which the editor page needs to be refreshed) or in the "Tags" subsection under the "Pages" section.

Once tags are added, in the "Related Pages" accordion, you can filter pages by the desired tag. Additionally, you can mark pages linked to this one in this setting. Afterward, these pages will be available in the "Related Posts" block of the ElasticPress plugin.

Ensure that the ElasticPress plugin is installed and configured on the website.
